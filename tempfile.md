# Welcome to DataBlackboard

My goal is to make data education attainable, affordable and approachable in the cloud computing era.

## What does that mean and why this is important?

When we talk about data literacy some people think about spreadsheets. Some talk about learning database systems or artificial intelligence. Though all of these answers are correct, can we simplify it further?

***Data literacy is the ability to apply evidence-based approach to analyze, make informed conclusions, and take actions.***

Data literacy can help us in both personal and professional lives. On the personal side, we will address things such as opportunities for savings, borrowing and investments. On the professional side, we will focus on acquiring specific skills which help you get a better job or a promotion.
